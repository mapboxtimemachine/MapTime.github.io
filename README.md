# MapTime.github.io


This is a little game about guessing from when a world map with flags on each country you get five tries and you see it the map is sooner or later then you entered, have fun!: https://maptime2.github.io

This game is inspired by idea of Drew Durnil who had this idea in one of his videos and he said it should be made into a game so I did just that.

This is my first github project so it is pretty bad. You can tell me what to do better next time.
